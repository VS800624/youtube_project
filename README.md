Debouncing: 

The difference between the two key stroke is very less , suppose if I tying the difference between the two key stroke is very high 

suppose in typing slow difference between key strokes = 200ms  
and in typing fast = 30ms

Performance: 
    -iphone pro max = 14 letters * 1000 people typing = 14000 API calls
    -with debouncing = 3 API calls * 1000 people typing = 3000 API calls

Debouncing with 200ms 
 -if difference two key strokes is  < 200ms then decline the API calls
 - if it is > 200ms make an API call


Cache: 
time complexity to search in array = O(n)  (order of n)
time complexity to search in object = O(1)
